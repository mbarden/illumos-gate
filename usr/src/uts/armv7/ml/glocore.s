 * useful to remember what the loader set up for us:
 *
 * - unaligned access are allowed (A = 0, U = 1)
 * - virtual memory is enabled
 *   - we (unix) are mapped right were we want to be
 *   - a UART has been enabled & any memory mapped registers have been 1:1
 *     mapped
 *   - ATAGs have been updated to tell us what the mappings are
 * - I/D L1 caches have been enabled
